### **Slide 1 — Title**

Good morning everyone.  
My name is Du Jinnuo, and I’m a Computer Science and Technology major.  
Today, I’d like to briefly introduce my research interest in **data center network systems**, a field that I find both challenging and fascinating.

### **Slide 2 — Why Computer Science Interests Me**

What attracts me most to computer science is that it studies **complex systems created by humans**.  
Unlike natural sciences, computer systems are designed layer by layer, from hardware to software.  
I’m especially interested in operating systems and computer networks, because they reveal how abstraction and performance come together.  
I believe that with enough effort, any computer system can eventually be understood.

### **Slide 3 — What Is a Data Center Network**

A data center network is the backbone of modern computing.  
It connects thousands of servers and switches to support cloud services, AI workloads, and large-scale online applications.  
These networks must handle massive traffic, high concurrency, and strict latency requirements, all at the same time.

### **Slide 4 — Why Performance Matters**

Performance is extremely important in data center networks.  
Even small inefficiencies can lead to higher latency, wasted bandwidth, and poor user experience.  
For large-scale services, a tiny performance loss can translate into significant cost and energy waste.  
That’s why performance optimization is a central problem in this field.

### **Slide 5 — Performance vs. Scalability**

However, performance is not the only goal.  
Data center networks must also be highly scalable.  
They need to support thousands of machines and millions of flows without becoming unstable.  
This creates a key challenge: how to improve performance **without sacrificing scalability**.

---

### **Slide 6 — My Research Focus**

My research focuses on optimizing data center network performance under scalability constraints.  
I’m interested in techniques such as improved congestion control, fine-grained network measurement, and programmable data planes.  
The goal is to push system performance closer to its limits while keeping solutions practical and deployable.

### **Slide 7 — Why This Research Matters**

This research is meaningful because data center networks support almost everything we use today.  
Better performance means faster services, lower resource consumption, and more efficient infrastructure.  
It’s a field that combines theory, systems design, and real-world impact.

### **Slide 8 — Conclusion**

To conclude, I’m passionate about understanding complex computer systems, especially data center networks.  
I believe computer science is understandable because it is human-designed.  
Through continuous learning and research, I hope to better understand these systems and contribute to building faster and more efficient networks.

Thank you for listening.
